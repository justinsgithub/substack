# Why you fail at fitness

> Tips to succeed in making fitness apart of your life

### The struggle, you are not alone

Americans have a challenging time sticking with their health and fitness goals. Studies have shown that about 40% of Americans set New Years resolutions. Approximately 50% of those are related to health and fitness. Approximately 10% of people stick with these resolutions, with 23% quitting within a week, and 43% quitting within a month.

What makes improving your fitness difficult? Why do the large majority of us fail? What can we do differently?

The big issue stems from how humans are genetically wired. Our primary (though not only) motivation in life comes from our survival instincts. The brain mainly facilitates this through a molecule named dopamine, using the dopaminergic pathways. This is a system our brain uses to send messages to other areas of the brain and send signals to our body (our motivation and reward system). These messages basically tell us when doing a certain task is beneficial to our survival and motivate us to do more of it. In the modern world technology has evolved to rapidly for our brains to catch up with it, which has resulted in a malfunctioning system for many people.

From an evolutionary standpoint, common tasks that have been essential to survival, include the following:

- Eating, especially calorie dense foods. The more energy you can store, the better chance you have of surviving a famine or long periods without food. This is why we love calorie packed foods such as sweets and chips.

- Mating, having kids helps ensure the longest chances of our survival through the passing of our genes. Sex, or even expectation of it, is one of the most potent dopamine releasing activities.

- Acquiring information, this help with things such as finding food to eat, or finding a new mate. This is why it is easy to get spend so much time scrolling on social media. Although much of the content we are seeing is completely useless, new information is all the same to our brain, so our dopaminergic pathways are sending the message that what we are doing is good and to keep doing it. 

- Exercise and exploration. This is why going on hikes feels so good, even if we don't do it as much as we want or don't have the energy (possibly due to our dopamine system being over-stimulated from the above activities). As we evolved, physical exertion meant we were maybe on a hunt or going to war with another tribe. These were necessary things to do so our brain uses dopamine to encourage us to do more of it.


In modern day life, our survival mechanisms are causing us to eat too much and prioritize our time on the wrong things.


### The confidence to succeed

The key to succeeding in our goals is determining what it is that you are truly after, and learning to tap into the motivation system of your mind. 

First of all, why is it that you want to improve your fitness? Many of us have the desire to look better, lose weight, build muscle, or something along those lines. No matter what the goal is, the underlying cause can be boiled down to having more confidence. We are not satisfied with the way we see ourselves or the way we ***feel*** others see us. Learning to incorporate fitness as a part of your daily lifestyle is an excellent way to build confidence that will transfer over to all other areas of your life as well.

So why is it sticking with a fitness routine so difficult? It goes back to our evolutionary instincts for survival. For the majority of human life, food was more scarce and it was of  utmost importance to conserve as much energy as possible. We always needed to be doing something that was productive such as attaining food, gathering information, exploring new areas, or mating. Otherwise it was essential that we did as little as possible and rested.

Our subconscious mind is powerful and controls pretty much everything we do. Even when we think it is our conscious brain driving our actions, it is the subconscious that initiates the ideas and thought patterns that get us to that point. Although we may think we know exercise is good for us in the long term and will surely improve our quality of life, our subconscious needs more data than that to motivate us.

Getting visible results in fitness is a long process. For instance, it can take an entire month to grow just 1 pound of muscle, and the result certainly is not going to be visible until multiple pounds are gained. The same goes with losing body fat. Not counting water weight, the most fat you can sustainably lose is going to be 1 pound a week at the most (despite what the people trying to sell you something tell you). It takes time and patience, self-improvement is a life long process that takes time, anything worth having does not come easy (or quickly).

### The solution, your brain's reward system

In order to get your brain to give you the dopamine and motivation that you need to stick with improving your fitness, you need to give it some objective data. You need to make your brain see that what you are doing is actually productive and worth expending the energy. Unfortunately many people try using the scale to do this, which is going to have the opposite effect on your brain. Using your weight to track performance is an invalid way to measure, the body is far too complex with the way is stores water from your skin to your muscle. How much water is stored in various systems of your body depends on, sodium intake, how much you sweat that day, the time of day, and countless other factors. For instance, could lose 5 pounds of fat after a month, and actually weigh more on the scale due to increased lean muscle tissue and glycogen storage.

The best way to make make your brain see the value in your expended energy is to use simple performance metrics. Bring a notepad or use whatever notes app on your phone. 

Each time you do cardio:

- use a different type of cardio machine each workout, such as Mondays elliptical, Tuesdays bike, Wednesdays stair climber, Thursdays rower, etc...
- write down the type of cardio machine you used that day
- each time you use a certain machine, try to beat a previous record for that specific machine, such as distance, time, or calories burned

For example, the first Tuesday, try to set a new personal record for time spent biking, and only track that statistic. The next Tuesday do the same for calories burned. Using small but consistent benchmarks like this to improve upon will keep motivation higher and create long term results.

Each time you lift weights:

- write down the weight, reps, and sets you do for each exercise during your rest period
- each time you go to do that same exercise, either try to do a little more reps, sets, or increase the weight 

Don't even look at a scale or pay attention to your weight. After a month, you may not see a difference in the mirror yet, or feel any different. However if you are lifting more weight and also performing better at cardio, then you will have undeniable proof that you are making substantial progress. This will build your self-confidence in knowing that you really can improve yourself if you put your mind to it. This will spread to other areas of your life and you will start having the confidence to start applying yourself at anything you want. Start living to your fullest potential and being your most beautiful self.
