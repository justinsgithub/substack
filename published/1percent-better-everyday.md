# .1% Better Every Day

Micro self-improvement every day to live your best life


### Be ***your*** best self

In today's world, it is far too easy to get caught comparing yourself to other people. This can lead or contributes to issues such as depression, anxiety, and lack of motivation.
For example, when you see people making millions of dollars, or with perfect photoshoot-ready physiques, it is easy to let it discount any personal progress that you make in those areas. It is important remember that every human is completely unique in their life circumstances, challenges, and the place they start from. 

Never compare yourself to anyone aside from who you were yesterday. How you progress in life is completely relative to the life ***you*** live today.  You may see someone online who made 10,000 dollars yesterday, however if that person already has $1,000,000 in the bank, that means they made 0.1% of what they already have. A shallow view will make the average person feel severely inadequate if they only made $100 yesterday. Learn to look deeper into your own life and value and you may realize that you actually did amazing yesterday compared to the millionaire. If you only have $1,000 in your bank account, this means you made %1 of what you already have. This is a huge win and something you should be proud of. If you practice looking at everything in your life this way, it can lead to much better goal-setting and motivation to work towards the best life ***you*** can possibly live.

### The .1% philosophy

When find a new area of life that we want to set goals for, we often shoot far too high and as a result fall short. When you constantly fall short of any goal, it starts making you lose belief in yourself and diminishes your confidence overtime. As time goes and we don't feel any real progress or accomplishment in anything, the mindset of "why even bother?" starts to creep in. We settle for a mediocre life, living day to day, check to check, losing excitement or passion for anything and everything. Suddenly the most exciting part of your life is waiting for the next T.V. Series to come out, which leads to further procrastination and distracts you from the truly meaningful things in life.

I have always been passionate about self-improvement and personal-growth. Over the years I strove to be the best I could be in all facets of life, but always seemed to be taking 2 steps forward and 1 step back (or 3 steps back). Often I would get really interested in an idea and either burnout after a week of trying way too hard at it, or make good progress for a few months only to become unmotivated after progress slowed and the results didn't feel worth the energy I was putting into it. Eventually I developed a little more patience and came up with a more sustainable approach which has yielded immense benefits over the past year.

Getting closer to 30 than 20, I found myself not being able to put as much energy into the gym, work, or studying new subjects of interest like I used to. I realized I had to let go of being so extreme about things and just putting a little bit of focus into the things a care about every day was still better than nothing.

1. I started working more reasonable hours (relatively)
2. Cut my workouts every day down to 20 - 45 minutes as opposed to 60 - 90 minutes. 
3. Stopped being so strict about my diet and allowed myself some sugar and "unhealthy" snacks whenever I felt I needed a little more energy without feeling guilty about it. 
4. Removed my hard rule of reading for 1 hour every night and just read as much as I feel, which is sometimes only 5 minutes.

At first it felt like my progress in most areas had almost completely stalled, but after 6 months I started noticing small improvement. After a year those tiny improvements have really added up and the results have been amazing.

1. Working more reasonable hours put way less stress on me, so my brain chemicals were more balanced and I stopped wasting so much money on impulsive purchases or drinking, so I ended up having more money in the bank than I ever have.
2. Cutting my workout time down made them much more intense and I recovered much better, which led to me being in the best shape I have ever been in.
3. Being less strict on my diet stopped me from having bad cravings and binging on foods that I would normally completely deprive myself of.
4. Only reading as much as I really wanted to allowed me to digest information much more easily and stop from getting bored on a subject before I got as much as I could out of it. Instead of spending a couple weeks intensely studying a topic and then getting burned out. I was able to stay on the same topic for months until I really felt I had gotten all I could out of it, put it into practice, and move onto something new.

These are just some of the improvements that have led me to the best quality of life that I have had yet. This made me realize that even if I could just improve myself by 0.1% in different areas of my life every day I could continue to improve my quality of life at an unprecedented rate. Even if short term the improvement is unnoticeable, with some patience the results would undeniable be there.

### Compound interest

0.1% doesn't sound like much, because it isn't. It is easy to think that just doing even 10 push-ups a day, or reading for 5 minutes is a complete waste of time, so why bother? But just imagine... Today you are 100% of who you are. If every day you make microscopic improvements in the areas you care about, over time you could be the most incredible version of yourself. Lets use some measurement of fitness as an example to keep things simple.

| Lets say you start with only being able to do sets of 10 push-ups (or knee push-ups).

- After 1 month you would be 103% of who you were, you could still do only sets of 10 push-ups. (Okay maybe not worth it)
- After 3 months you would be 109% of who you were, you could do maybe sets of 11 push-ups instead of 10. (Still doesn't seem worth it)
- After 6 months you would be 120% of who you were, you could do sets of 12 push-ups. (Still seemingly little progress after 6 whole months)
- After 1 year you would be 144% of who you were, you could confidently do 15 push-ups. (This is actually some good progress despite taking a while to get there)
- You stick with it and after 2 years you are 207% of who you were, you can now do sets of 20 push-ups. This is incredible progress, applied to many facets of your life, you are now a 2x better version of yourself, living a substantially better quality of life, sustainably.

    After 4 years you are a 430% improved version of yourself, you stick with this philosophy and micro-habits and the possibilities are endless, the sky is the limit. You can truly live whatever life you want to live and love it. Start with extremely small changes that you can keep up for a lifetime, even its 5 push-ups, sit-ups, and squats every day. For long while it will seem like nothing is happening, but eventually that compound interest ***will*** become noticeable and once you get some momentum, you can accomplish whatever you desire. 

Become the best version of ***you***.
