# Understanding your Third Eye
> The PFC (prefrontal cortex) and how the role it plays in our mind

### Thousands of years of wisdom

Everyone has seen a piece of art where a human seems to have a cyclops looking eye sitting in the middle of their forehead. These works of art have been around for thousands of years and depict a higher level of consciousness. This area of the brain, right behind the forehead is called the "prefrontal cortex" (PFC). The PFC has been deemed the "seat of consciousness" and determines a large majority of who we are, or who we end up being.

The prefrontal cortex is responsible for things such as:

- planning complex behavior 
- personality expression 
- decision making 
- moderating social behavior


### CEO of our brain

The functions of our PFC are known "executive functions". You can think of the PFC has being like the CEO of our brain. It is responsible for complex decision making and determining our behavior in different social contexts. The PFC is the reason we are able to let loose and be funny around our friends at home, and then be more serious when we are in a meeting at work.

Examples of executive functions:

- differentiating between good and bad thoughts
- deciding which action to take is better than the other
- knowing future consequences of our current actions
- moderating behavior when the situation calls for it (I am sure have seen some obnoxious people who are weak in this area)
