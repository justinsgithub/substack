### Quotes from MindPump Podcast Episode 517

Support everyone, love even the ugly, because the ugly got ugly somehow.

When you find out that this thing we call a soul is God within you, and its there all the time, totally willing to guide you and support you, it's quite a marvelous experience.

Opportunity always had to have resistance nearby or there is no action potential.

The resistance on the heroes journey has to be there, or the hero cannot be made, and we are not sure who we really are until we make a hero out of ourselves. But the trick is only you can decide when you are hero enough to stop trying so hard to prove something. And that is the day you become a man or a woman.

There is only one of you. And behind you there is no other, the only one that can judge your performance in the grand play of life is you. And the only position you can judge it from is an ego until you grow up enough to say to your soul, 'what do you think, how did we do?' and the soul is always going to say 'we did great, how do you feel? Are you happy? If you're happy, I'm happy'.

God has to be an asshole or nothing that is non-asshole can exist. Just like up can't exist without down, in cannot exist without out. 

People have this childish view of God but they forget, God is the light and the dark, the in and the out, the up and the down, the high and the low, the beautiful and the ugly. 

I don't like the drug industry for the same reason I don't like religion for money. Because the drug industry preys on keeping people sick to keep selling and making money. It is not a healthcare system, it is a disease maintenance system, they got drugs scheduled for you from cradle to grave. You are an investment that they have to maintain, this is a simple fact, and this the food industry, this is many industries, the whole medical industry, the drug industry. Look at the billions and billions of dollars made off just 1 disease like diabetes.

Some people are just too lazy to actually take care of the gift of the body because they are not awake enough to realize how freakin magnificent the human body is, and what a miracle it is to have one. So it is taken has a given, it is taken for granted.

The shadow and the light forever dance with each other and it is up to us to decide when we are being honest enough and loving enough, that we can handle being alone with ourselves.

Steiner says the first thing that happens when you die, is you find yourself surrounded by others that are just like you. And you stay there until you are absolutely sick of yourself and sure of what you will never do again in your next lifetime.

Talking about God as a noun is easy, people do it all the time. And they delude themselves in thinking just because they say fancy words about God, and read cool books about God, that they are spiritually evolved. But God is not real until God is a verb.

You can only take with you when you die, what you become in life.

Love is that reciprocity. I define love as the flow of energy and information through empathic and / or compassionate connection to self or other.

There is a lot of pain people create for themselves by believing in stories about what God doesn't want. And I say love is a boomerang. And to me the highest form of God is the highest form of love, which is unconditional love. Which means the answer is always yes, for God to say no creates a condition. That means God has needs, and that's not very Godly.

God is supposed to be everything and have everything. Therefore if you are everything and have everything, there is not much you need to want, since you already have it anyhow.
