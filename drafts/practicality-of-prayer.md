# The Practicality of Prayer

Humans have evolved constantly striving to improve and survive the best way they possibly can. As a result of the desire to live in the best way possible, religion was always a staple of life until recent times.
Many people have thrown out religion for science, without acknowledging that much of science only confirms what the wisdom of religion has already told us. This includes things such as fasting and all of the health benefits that come with it.

Lately I have felt a little... "lack-luster" lets say, and have started being more intentful about praying every morning as soon as I wake up. I have always been more of a skeptic than not, and never believe anything until I have objective proof that I have tested myself.
Praying every morning has definitley made me feel better throughout the day, and after some consideration, it is pretty obvious why.

There are many tangible benefits for prayer aside from any religious or spiritual ideas. When I pray, I express gratitude for the things that I am greatful for recently. 
Gratitude has been shown to be a huge effect on overall happiness and health. I also pray that my loved ones and those close to me are doing well, which helps remind to keep in contact a little better and take more attention to important relationships.
Part of my prayer is to help succeed in whatever I do throughout the day, which also helps me set goals for the day and make sure i am focusing on the right things.

I also make sure to give thanks for any of the food I eat throughout the day. Thank the plants and animals that are going to replenish me and join me on this long journey through life together. 
I also apologize for the terrible conditions that I know many plants and animals are raised in and hope one day to play a better part in supporting more ethical and sustainable farming practices.
When I eat things that are suboptimal such as sweets or candy, I give thanks for all the simple pleasures in life and ask for the awareness to not indulge too and lose the satisfaction in them.

Even if you do not believe in religion, I encourage you to start building some kind of spiritual practice that can help lead you to a more fulfilling and satisfying life.
